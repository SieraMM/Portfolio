                <h4 id="topper"> Overview</h4>
                <p id="topper"> My team was tasked with finding a Non-Profit website to redesign. We were drawn to Art
                    Pride NJ for
                    two reasons:
                    they are great advocates for art programs in New Jersey and their art website was clearly lacking
                    art. We wanted
                    to design a website that would show off NJ artists and act as a hub for the art community.</p>

                <h2>Research </h2>

                <p>Here are photos of the original homepage, which can be found at <a href="https://artpridenj.org/"
                        class="bodyLink" target="_blank">Artpridenj.org:</a></p>

            <div class="container">
                <p>We began our research with <b>heuristic evaluation </b> of key pages of the website. On the homepage,
                    we
                    noted
                    a lack of art, large chunks of text and whitespace, and a disorganized footer. </p>



                <p> Our next step was a <b>competitor’s analysis </b>to better understand how other sites in the arts
                    advocacy
                    space were designed. We choose Minnesota State Arts Board and Americans for the Arts (AA) as direct
                    competitor as our group was most familiar with their work. Both sites were text-heavy, but AA had an
                    alluring color scheme. Our indirect competitor was Visit NJ because they were not an arts advocacy
                    site
                    but they had an in-depth list of all art-related events in New Jersey. This allows community members
                    to
                    connect to the art scene.
                </p>
                <p>NJ Art Pride advocates in the government for more art funding and aims to increase attendance to art
                    events
                    by connecting the public to the arts scene. While their advocacy work is up front and center, they
                    don’t focus
                    as much on the art scene they are advocating for.</p>

                <p>With Finn in mind, we designed an interview and survey to gain more insight into our user. I
                    conducted
                    two interviews,
                    and in total we had 6 interviews and 7 survey responses.</p>
                <p> We discovered the 5 key categories that interested our users: <b>Art & Community, Membership, Site
                        Needs, Where Users
                        connect online,</b> and <b>Issues</b>.</p>

        <h2> What I Learned</h2>
        <p> This was the first time I ever redesigned a website. Unlike design from the ground up, there are certain
            details of the website
            that I could not change. For example, there were so many pages in the upper navigation that made it seem
            crowded. However, without any input from the stakeholder, I did not know which pages, if any, could be
            altered or removed. </p>

        <p> In this project, I practiced using components to build out an interactive navigation menu. At first our mega
            menu did not have any images, but our teacher pointed out how empty it looked, so we adjusted.</p>
        <p> If we had more time, we would reach out to our stakeholders again to see the most important pages on their
            site and other important data.
            We reached out to them in the beginning of our project with no response.Their input would have only made our
            project more realistic.</p>
